These scripts assume that Postgres with PostGIS plugins is already installed. The scripts load only the block-group and census tract TIGER geometries -- another way to load TIGER geometries is to use [the TIGER geocoder stuff](http://postgis.net/docs/Loader_Generate_Census_Script.html). The scripts then load the full American Community Survey data set, using SQL from the [Census Reporter project](https://github.com/censusreporter/census-postgres).
